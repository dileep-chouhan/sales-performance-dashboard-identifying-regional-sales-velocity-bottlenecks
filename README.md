# Sales Performance Dashboard: Identifying Regional Sales Velocity Bottlenecks

**Overview:**

This project develops a sales performance dashboard to visualize sales data by region, identify bottlenecks hindering sales velocity, and inform data-driven interventions.  The analysis focuses on identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and their regional variations to pinpoint areas requiring focused attention for improved sales performance.  The dashboard provides a clear and concise overview of sales trends, enabling quick identification of problematic regions and facilitating strategic decision-making.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script requires a properly formatted CSV data file (refer to the `data` directory for an example) to be present in the same directory.  Modify the file path in `main.py` if necessary.

**Example Output:**

The script will produce the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis summarizing key findings, including regional sales performance comparisons and potential bottlenecks.  This includes statistical summaries and high-level observations.

* **Plot Files:**  One or more visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `regional_comparison.png`) will be generated in the `output` directory, providing a visual representation of the sales data and identified bottlenecks. These plots will show sales trends over time, regional comparisons, and other relevant visualizations to support the analysis.


**Data:**

Example data is provided in the `data` directory.  You will need to replace this with your own data for a meaningful analysis.  The data should be in CSV format with appropriate columns representing region, sales figures, and relevant time information.
